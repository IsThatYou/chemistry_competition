				<h2>How it is removed</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> Some natural gas flows freely because of the natural pressure of the underground reservoir forces the gas through the reservoir rocks. These types of gas wells only need a series of pipes and valves on the surface that are used to control the flow of gas. But only a few places have this free-flowing gas in the U.S. </p>
					<p> Thus we need a way to deal with non-flowing gas.  One of the most common is the “horsehead” pump, which rocks up and down to lift a rod in and out of a wellbore, bringing gas and oil to the surface. Its efficiency can be greatly improved by creating tiny cracks in rocks, namely fractures.  It provides an open pathway for gas to flow through.  </p>
				</div>

				<h2>Procedure and Process</h2>

				<div class="work">
					<li data-panel="panel-2"><a href="#"><img src="images/ngc.png" /></a></li>
					<p> Natural gas (1) is pumped into the gas turbine (2), where it is mixed with air (3) and burned, converting its chemical energy into heat energy. And that's the part where the chemical reaction happens. Burning natural gas also produces a mixture of gases called the combustion gas which creates pressurein the gas turbine to spin.  Therefore the gas turbine generator (4) spins as well, using an electromagnetic field to convert this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
					</p>
					<p>
					After passing through the gas turbine, the still-hot combustion gas is piped to the heat recovery steam generator (5). Here it is used to heat pipes full of water, turning the water to steam, before escaping through the exhaust stack (6). Natural gas burns very cleanly, but the stack is still built tall so that the exhaust gas plume (7) can disperse before it touches the ground. This ensures that it does not affect the quality of the air around the station.
					 </p>
					<p>  </p>
				</div>

				<h2>Composition and Reactions</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> natural gas is a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases. While natural gas is formed primarily of methane, it can also include ethane, propane, butane and pentane. The composition of natural gas can vary widely, but below is a chart outlining the typical makeup of natural gas before it is refined.</p>

				<h2>Enviromental Issues</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> At the power plant, the burning of natural gas produces nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, but in lower quantities than burning coal or oil. >Methane, a primary component of natural gas and a greenhouse gas, can also be emitted into the air when natural gas is not burned completely. Similarly, methane can be emitted as the result of leaks and losses during transportation. Emissions of sulfur dioxide and mercury compounds from burning natural gas are negligible.</p>

					<p> The United States petroleum industry has been a prominent one since the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania in the mid 1800s. The United States, as of 2008, was named the world’s third largest oil producer, producing approximately 8.5 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids per day; indeed, the highest oil production was in the Gulf of Mexico, as the region produced approximately 1.15 million barrels per day. The second highest oil producing region was Texas (1.09 million barrels), the third was Alaska (0.68 million barrels), and the fourth was California (0.59 million barrels). </p>

				<h2>How it is removed</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> 
						The practice of drilling is not overly complicated, and can be accomplished through many techniques; however, the most common technique has four parts: drilling, completion, production, abandonment. </p>
						<p>
						The first step is drilling; to begin a hole is drilled between 10 and 75 centimeters wide into a precise location in the ground. A metal pipe is implemented to ensure the hole does not collapse, and then the hole is then drilled deeper until they have reached a “suitable depth.” </p>
						<p>The second step is completion, where holes are drilled in the side of the metal piping to ensure that oil is able to flow freely into the main hole that was originally drilled. </p>
						<p>
							The third step is production, where the oil is extracted from the ground; since there is high pressure in the narrow drill hole, the oil rises to the surface. Another method to remove the oil is through a mechanical pump. </p>
							<p>The last step is abandonment; the well is abandoned once the oil has been retrieved from it.  
						  </p>
				</div>

				<h2>Procedure and Process</h2>

				<div class="work">
					<li data-panel="panel-12"><a href="#"><img src="images/oilpic.png" /></a></li>
					<p>1. The oil is piped into the boiler </p>
					<p>2. In the boiler, the oil is burned, which converts its chemical energy into heat energy, while simultaneously heating the water, and in fact, turning it into steam, in the pipes wrapped around the boiler. The steam created expands the pipes, subsequently increasing pressure, taking the steam over the blades of the steam turbine.  
 </p>
					<p>3. When the steam is taken over the blades of the steam turbine, it causes the turbine to spin, ultimately causing the heat energy released into mechanical energy. 
 </p>
					<p>4. Since the turbine generator and the steam turbine are connected, when the turbine runs, so does the generator; the main goal of the generator is to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy with its electromagnetic field. 
 </p>
					<p>5. The steam, after passing through the turbine, makes it way to pipes with cold war; the water is pumped from the sea in stations near the coast. These cold pipes cool the steam, essentially condensing it back into water.
 </p>
					<p>6. Next, it is transported back into the boiler via pipes, where the process restarts.
 </p>
					<p>7. In the final step, the transformer converts the electrical energy produced by the generator into a higher voltage, and the national grid uses these high voltages to transport electricity through power lines to homes and businesses.   
 </p>

				</div>

				<h2>Composition and Reactions</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> Oil is composed of hydrocarbons; there are four main types of hydrocarbons found in crude oil: paraffins (15-60%), naphthenes (30-60%), aromatics (3-30%), and asphaltics (the remainder). These hydrocarbons are for the most part alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. Even though there are many variations, oil’s elemental composition is essentially defined: Carbon makes up approximately 83 to 87%, Hydrogen makes up approximately 10 to 14% , Nitrogen makes up approximately 0.1 to 2%, Oxygen makes up approximately 0.05 to 1.5%, Sulfur makes up 0.05 to 6.0%, and other metals, most commonly iron, nickel, copper, and vanadium, make up less than 0.1%. </p>
				</div>
				<li data-panel="panel-14"><a href="#"><img src="images/oilc.png" /></a></li>
				<div class="work">
					<p> In the above ideal reaction, the energy gained from the reaction is greater than the energy put into the reaction. It is common knowledge that a spark is needed to make a hydrocarbon burn. The spark represents the energy need to break the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds of the hydrocarbon molecule as well as the oxygen-oxygen bond of the oxygen molecule. The typical C-C bond requires 350 kJ/mol to break, the typical C-H bond requires 413 kJ/mol, and the O-O bond requires about 498 kJ/mol.
					</p>
					<p>
					We know, however, the energy is released from these reactions and it is released when new bonds are formed. The H-O bonds of water release about 464 kJ/mol of energy when formed and the C=O bonds of CO2 release about 800 kJ/mol when formed. The net outcome is the release of energy in the form of heat. </p>
				</div>
			

				<h2>Enviromental Issues</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> The dependence on oil is a danger to all aspects of our life: national security, economy, and the environment. Oil mining destroys natural habitats; it also is dangerous for the workers who mine the oil and residents who live in close proximity to the oil extraction. When oil is transported, and even burned, it emitts  carbon dioxide into the atmosphere along with other pollutants, intoxicating the air that we all breathe.</p>

				<h2>How it is removed</h2>
				<div class="work">
					<p> Surface mining is used in the hilly and mountainous areas of the Appalachians, where coal seams are numerous and are generally flat-lying or subhorizontal, outcropping on the steeply sloping valleys and ridges. The geologic column consists of shales, sandstones, and limestones of varying thickness and hardness.4
 </p>
					<p> When a coal seam does not lie close to the surface, it must be extracted by underground methods. The methods may be classified as room-and-pillar, longwall, and others. In each method, modifications to the basic techniques are needed to cope with varying geologic conditions and seam factors. Irregular seam thickness, steep dips, changing rock quality, seam partings, and other factors have a marked influence on the mine geometry and equipment specifications. 4  </p>

					<p>Coal Liquefaction</p>
					<p>Synthetic fuels may be produced from coal by either direct or indirect methods. In direct liquefaction processes, pulverized coal is suspended in a solvent, the resultant slurry is heated and exposed to gaseous hydrogen under pressure, and the liquids produced are separated from the ash and distilled to obtain the fuel fractions. In the indirect process, the coal is decomposed thermally to yield combustible gases, which are synthesized to yield gasoline, alcohols, and waxes. 1

					<p> Reaction (2) is highly endothermic, requiring 32 kilocalories/mole (134 kilojoules/mole). The principal thermodynamic issue in most practical gasification processes is how to supply the heat for this reaction. Several methods have been considered, but generally heat is supplied by allowing exothermic reactions (3) and (5) to occur in the same vessel as reaction (2). The degree to which one reaction or the other is used depends on the process configuration and the desired product. Reactions (4) and (5) are often carried out in downstream processing blocks in order to tailor the gas composition for particular end uses. In these arrangements it is generally not feasible to return the heat to the gasifier, as the downstream reactions are carried out at much lower temperatures.1</p>

					<p> This reaction represents a polymeric addition of methylene (—CH2—) groups to form a distribution of linear paraffins. In practice, a broad range of molecular weights is produced, and the product includes branched, olefinic, and oxygenated compounds, depending on reactor type, operating conditions, and catalyst type. The average molecular weight of the product mixture can be adjusted to some extent by the selection of process conditions.3</p>

Crude methanol can be utilized in three ways: as a neat fuel in fleet applications, as a gasoline blendstock, or as a feed to the Mobil methanol-to-gasoline process.3</p>
